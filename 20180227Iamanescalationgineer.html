What does a Microsoft Escalation Engineer do?

“If an Enterprise has a problem with it, we are the ones that are the last level, code level support. We’re the last step between the Serviceability team within Windows that would then provide hot-fixes.

One of the most rewarding things about this job is that it’s never the same thing twice.

If you have a question about Windows, there is nobody that knows more about Windows than this team collectively.

Not only are you trying to solve the problems but you also need to sort of manage your customers. If you’re talking to the CTO you might be a hostage negotiator.”

I like this jacket that I received as becoming an EE.
